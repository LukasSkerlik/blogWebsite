### `Blog website with full CRUD functionality`

This is a blog website that I developed for my own practice and for inclusion in my portfolio as well as a part of my course.

Live version can be accessed here: https://pilot-journal.herokuapp.com/

Worth noting: As the site is hosted on heroku on a free server (one based in Ireland) and not anywhere else simultaneously, the loading time might be harsh. This is not a fault of the code, but of the servers. Loading times may be different depending on where is this website accessed from

### `Important! known bugs`

Because of lodash functionality when it comes to lowercase function, it is currently impossible to add special characters to blog titles. Resolving in process.

### `Project not in active development`

Most likely only minor work regarding bugs will be done on this project. If you find any bugs, please send them to me here: skerlik.lukas@gmail.com.

### `Credits`

Initial html and css provided by initial files from the fullstack course by Angela Yu on udemy. Everything else, including functionality (though checked for the more initial functionality with files from Angela Yu, not with some of the added features such as update and delete) via JS and node, all changes to css and html code and logic by me.
